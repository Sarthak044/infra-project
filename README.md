# infra-project

This project is based on an infrastucture that is made from terraform with the help of jenkins. I will try to make it for AWS but now using EKS which will make things complex but still it will a good  way to learn things, as well as I will try to deploy a local kubernetes cluster using the these tools. Jenkins will make the pipeline and terraform will construct my AWS cloud deployment. I will ve adding all the files here.
